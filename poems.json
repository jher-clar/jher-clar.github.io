    "poem": "With hues of pink and gold so grand,\nDawn breaks across the sleeping land,\nA gentle breeze begins to sigh,\nAs darkness fades from the eastern sky.\n\nBirds awaken with songs so sweet,\nAs dewdrops kiss the flowers' feet,\nA symphony of life anew,\nAs nature wakes, refreshed and true.\n\nIn this dance of day's first light,\nAll shadows flee from the vibrant sight,\nWith every step, a new embrace,\nAs the world awakens with grace.",

    "poem": "In chambers of the heart, memories reside,\nEchoes of laughter, where moments glide,\nOf love and loss, a bittersweet array,\nIn the silent theatre of yesterday.\n\nEach beat, a drum, to stories untold,\nIn the depths of feeling, both brave and bold,\nA tapestry woven with joy and pain,\nIn the heart's rhythm, a soft refrain.\n\nAs the echoes linger, clear and bright,\nThey paint the soul with day's warm light,\nIn this grand hall, where time is kept,\nWhere the heart's own secrets softly slept.",
